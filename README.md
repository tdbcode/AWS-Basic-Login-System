# AWS Basic Login System using ReactJS
A basic login and registration system for users using AWS DynamoDB and ReactJS

Teaching myself how to use AWS and DynamoDB. This is a basic login system connecting to a DynamoDB table. It allows a user to login and register a new account.

TODO: Implement authorization using an API.
TODO: Secure user passwords in the table
TODO: Make the system more secure (including the management of the keys - at the moment using .gitignore to avoid uploading them to GitHub).
